Repo for EDLD 654: Machine Learning at University of Oregon | Fall 2022

Across the entire United States, avocados are being sold everyday in high volume despite their fluctuating price. Our goal for this project was to create a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting a given state's avocado price over time across states. The purpose of this project is to provide consumers, local grocers, and farmer's markets with a simple tool to predict avocado prices so that the largest profits are not taken by large-chain grocery stores.

We will be answering the research question: What is the strongest predictor of avocado prices in the United States? Thus, our goal is to find the feature in the data that most strongly predicts the price of avocados in the United States.

Variables:
- date - The date of the observation
- average_price - the average price of a single avocado
- type - conventional or organic
- year - the year of the observation
- region - the city or region of the observation
- total_volume - Total number of avocados sold

Models Used for Fitting:
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
